Centrifuge is an open, decentralized operating system which provides a method to create, exchange, and use the data that is used in the financial supply chain. It creates transparent and shareable relationships between interacting companies.

This project documents the procedure to setup a Centrifuge Node. For the step by step procedure, see [Docs](https://developer.centrifuge.io/docs/overview/introduction).
