## The Centrifuge Stack

![](../../../src/images/chain/cent-stack.jpeg)

The Centrifuge Operating System is a decentralized platform to support a new generation of applications for the financial supply chain. It enables businesses to exchange financial documents such as invoices, and tokenize those assets to have greater access to financing — thereby unlocking value that has previously been inaccessible. 



## Centrifuge Chain
[Centrifuge Chain](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain) is the gateway for real-world assets to the Blockchain Multiverse. It is being built on [Parity Substrate](https://substrate.dev) with an initial bridge to Ethereum. 

Substrate will allow us to easily tap into the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network) ecosystem at a future point in time as well as re-using [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crosschain) modules to connect with other blockchains that support the standard.

We envision a larger ecosystem of many, connected blockchains—where Centrifuge Chain can [enable off-chain assets to access financing](https://medium.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain-the-gateway-for-real-world-assets-to-the-blockchain-multiverse-41dd5597ecf1) through DeFi.
