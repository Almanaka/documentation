## Getting Testnet Tokens

To run a validator you need to stake Amber Radial (ARAD) or Flint Radial (FRAD) tokens.

Thanks to [BlockXLabs](https://blockxlabs.com/) you can get FRAD testnet tokens for Flint from their [Flint faucet](https://faucets.blockxlabs.com/centrifuge)! (Amber will follow soon â€” in the meantime ping us on our slack channel). 

Once you are ready and need more ARAD/FRAD for staking, please reach out to us at chain@centrifuge.io with your address so we can send you the appropriate amount.
