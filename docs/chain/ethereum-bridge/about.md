# About the Centrifuge Chain <> Ethereum Bridge

Centrifuge Chain supports the [ChainSafe Bridge Pallet](https://github.com/ChainSafe/chainbridge-substrate) which enables users to securely move assets between Centrifuge Chain and Ethereum. It is a bi-directional blockchain bridge to allow data and value transfer between both chains.

The Centrifuge<>Ethereum Bridge currently has 6 whitelisted, trusted relayers to both networks that have been added through on-chain democracy referenda. The authorized set currently includes 2 Centrifuge relayers and 4 external relayers that are also validators on Centrifuge Chain: PureStake, ChorusOne, Staked.us, and Stake Capital.

Read more about the bridge design in the [ChainBridge Specification](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ChainBridge/blob/master/docs/spec.md).

**The Centrifuge<>Ethereum bridge currently supports Substrate Native <> ERC20 token transfers.**
