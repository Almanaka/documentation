## Build a Use Case

Welcome to the bonus mission of Discord missions!
Submit a PR to our documentation under this section and provide a potential use case that Centrifuge can tap into, using the following categories:

- **Through the lens of an asset originator**
  - Which markets around the world could benefit most from asset financing through centrifuge?
- **DeFi protocol composability**
  - Centrifuge has started working with MakerDAO and Aave to create instant liquidity for Tinlake pools. What are other great partnership use cases for Centrifuge?
- **Centrifuge Chain (the home for RWA)**
  - Centrifuge Chain is built for RWA origination. Tinlake is a great use case of what can be done with the Centrifuge chain. What are some other cases you can see for the Centrifuge chain?
- **Polkadot**
  - Interoperability is crucial for DeFiâ€™s success. What are some other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem that you think Centrifuge should integrate with?
Litentry interoperability.
For increased interoperability, Centrifuge should consider integrating with the cross-chain identify aggregator Litentry. The Litentry protocol features identity matching and identity staking mechanism in order to keep track of identities across distributed ecosystems. Being a substrate build cross-chain identity aggregator, Litentry could introduce benefits for both for Centrifuge governance as well as value locked in Tinlake pools as per the following considerations. 
1. Ensure a decentralized governance mechanism for the Centrifuge governance system.
To strengthen the Centrifuge governance system, Litentry could be employed to ensure a decentralized governance mechanism by connecting identities to CFG holders. This could ensure transparency and facilitate that no centralization could lead to conflict of interest when it comes to voting. Both with regard to governance proposals as well as the election of the Centrifuge Chain Council. By ensuring a decentralized governance, Centrifuge users could rest assured that no single entity could hold a disproportional sway on governance proposal without this being known to the community. Such decentralized governance would imbue increased trust into the Centrifuge protocol and hopefully attract more liquidity, investors and assets contributors.  
2. Allow decentralized lending and credit platforms to increase the value being locked in Tinlake pools. 
By introducing decentralized identity management, Litentry has the potential to reduce the current overcollateralization seen in decentralized lending and credit platforms such as Aave. By attaching identities to wallet addresses, borrowing and lending platforms could reduce their risks and increase their current Loan to Value (LTV) ratio. This would allow said platforms to reduce their overcollateralization, making it possible for these known entities to borrow more and thereby increasing the liquidity of Tinlake pools as a result of the Centrifuge and Aave collaboration.  

For any of these categories above ðŸ‘‰ submit a PR to detail how each use case could work. Make sure to think about the entire flow, technology, and size of the potential!
